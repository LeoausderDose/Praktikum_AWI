\section{Sample}
\label{sec:sample}

The sample used is a sample of nanorods depicted in \ref{fig:NanoDotSketch}. 
The sample was created through electron beam lithography. It is placed on a cover glass (BK7) with an estimated thickness of around \SI{170}{\micro\meter}. The structure stands at a height of \SI{35}{\nano\meter} and is composed of silver, where in contrast to gold, all electrons can be approximated as free electrons. Due to the writing and deposition process, the structure is planar and consists of nanorods with widths of \SI{70}{\nano\meter} and \SI{90}{\nano\meter} and variable length L. The length of the nanorods, denoted as L, is varied.
