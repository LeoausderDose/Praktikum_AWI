During this internship, our main emphasis was on understanding the impact of the melting process on the Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR). Nonetheless, other factors such as snow cover, wind patterns, and cloud coverage also play a crucial role. It's worth noting that the argument regarding the melting process becomes less relevant during the summer months when there is no ice or snow left.

However, it's important to consider the presence of a glacier near Ny-Alesund. This glacier could potentially contribute to cooler air conditions in the summer due to its melting. Therefore, in cases where temperatures rise above the melting point, there is a possibility that warm air could be displaced upwards by this melting glacier, influencing local temperature variations.
