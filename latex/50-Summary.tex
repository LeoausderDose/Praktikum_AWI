\label{chap:sumamry}
In this practical course we had some first insight in the field of plasmonics. With the dark field microscopy we learned a new technique which allows a background free investigation of plasmonics below its actual resolution limit. Therefore, we were able to measure transversal and longitudinal plasmonic modes. Here we could show, that indeed only the longitudinal modes show a maximum wavelength dependence in respect to the rodlength.
