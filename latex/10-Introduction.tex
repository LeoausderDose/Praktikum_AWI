The diurnal temperature range (DTR), defined as the difference between daily minimum temperatures ($T_{\mathrm{min}}$) and daily maximum temperatures ($T_{\mathrm{max}}$), has exhibited a decline both globally and on various regional scales since the 1960s \cite{Easterling.1997, Karl.1993, Alexander.2006}. This reduction can be attributed to the accelerated rise in mean surface minimum temperatures outpacing that of maximum temperatures, as shown by Karl et al. in 1993 \cite{Karl.1993}. Although the quantitative understanding of the driving mechanisms behind this phenomenon is still incomplete, it is evident that the asymmetrical warming trend is connected to external factors. These factors encompass greenhouse gas emissions, aerosols, changes in landscape due to land use, as well as their consequential effects, such as shifts in cloud cover and relative humidity. \cite{Zhou.2010, Lewis.2013, Liu.2016, Christidis.2016}.

The extent of change in DTR is of magnitudes smaller than the trends in mean surface temperatures ($T_{\mathrm{mean}}$). Therefore, the uncertainty in these trends is larger than that of surface mean temperature, and they were only assessed with medium confidence in the fourth and fifth IPCC reports \cite{.2014}.
This study focuses on a specific geographic context, namely the Arctic, where the rate of warming in mean surface temperatures surpasses that of any other region globally, driven by the phenomenon of Arctic amplification \cite{Pithan.2014}. Simultaneously, the Arctic experiences a high climate variability, diminishing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in mean surface temperature trends, as recently highlighted by Hartmuth et al. in 2023 \cite{Hartmuth.2023}. Given the absence of a linear relationship between diurnal temperature range and mean temperature on a global scale, there is a compelling rationale to explore whether the trends in DTR exhibit a higher SNR within the Arctic region. In the following, we investigate the dominant mechanisms driving changes in DTR in the polar region and whether DTR trends could serve as a more dependable parameter for monitoring and understanding changes in polar climates.

% The diurnal temperature range (DTR), the difference between daily minimum temperatures ($T_{\mathrm{min}}$) and daily maximum temperatures ($T_{\mathrm{max}}$), decreases on a global scale and in many regional scales since the 1990s \cite{Easterling.1997,Karl.1993,Alexander.2006}. This decrease is caused by the mean surface minimum temperatures rising faster than the maximum temperatures \cite{Karl.1993}. The reasons for this dynamic are quantitatively not fully understood yet, but the asymmetry in warming has been linked to factors of external forcing such as greenhouse gases, aerosols, and changes in landscape due to land use, as well as secondary effects such as changes in cloudiness and relative humidity \cite[text]{Zhou.2010,Lewis.2013,Liu.2016,Christidis.2016}. The extent of change in DTR is of magnitudes smaller than the trends in mean surface temperatures ($T_{\mathrm{mean}}$). The uncertainty in these trends surpasses that of surface mean temperature, and they were only assessed with medium confidence in the fourth and fifth IPCC reports \cite{.2014}.

% In this work, we examine the DTR for the Arctic region. The mean surface temperatures in the Arctic warm more rapidly than in any other region on Earth due to Arctic amplification \cite{Pithan.2014}. At the same time, the Arctic shows great climate variability, which decreases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the trends in mean surface temperature\cite{Hartmuth.2023}. As there is no linear coupling between the diurnal temperature range and the mean temperature, the DTR might be less influenced by the high climate variability. In the following, we examine whether the trends in the diurnal temperature range show a better SNR in the Arctic region than the mean surface temperature. This could lead to a more robust parameter to track changes in the polar regions.

% In section (sec1), we investigate factors causing the trends in the Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR) at the AWIPEV meteorological station in Spitsbergen. Since the average temperatures in Antarctica have not changed despite climate change, in section (ref), we address the question of whether there have been shifts in the daily temperature range.
